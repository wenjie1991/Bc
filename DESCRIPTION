Description: 
  The package CellBarcode performs Cellular DNA Barcode analysis. It can handle
  all kinds of DNA barcodes, as long as the barcode is within a single sequencing
  read and has a pattern that can be matched by a regular expression.
  \code{CellBarcode} can handle barcodes with flexible lengths, with or without
  UMI (unique molecular identifier). This tool also can be used for pre-processing
  some amplicon data such as CRISPR gRNA screening, immune repertoire sequencing,
  and metagenome data.
